# Project Report

This project examines how global audiences react to China when exposed through the livestreams of American mega-streamer IShowSpeed. Using YouTube live chat data from streams in **Shanghai** and **Chongqing**, the study investigates whether livestream chats represent chaotic online noise or meaningful patterns of perception.
Analyzing **2,000** chat comments through sentiment analysis and keyword exploration, the findings show that most reactions are neutral and observational, with positive sentiment consistently outweighing negative sentiment. These patterns suggest that livestream audiences behave as digital tourists, observing unfamiliar places rather than engaging in political judgment.
