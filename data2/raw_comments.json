    "text": "I don’t know if those in the comments section have ever been to North Korea. According to tourists who have visited, when you go there, you really do have someone following you everywhere during your tour—you have zero freedom. The guides will take you through the most prosperous and beautiful parts of North Korea. Conversely, as a foreign tourist, you’re completely prevented from seeing the poorer, more impoverished areas and people. Speed’s trip in China is just like in North Korea. In China, my hometown is a very non-modernized rural village. My parents earn $300 a month. So I personally believe these videos are all scripts arranged by China for Speed. He’s like a puppet on strings—maybe paid, maybe not. China is nothing like what’s shown in the videos. China is currently very backward. We don’t have Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Sony, or Nintendo. What China does have is the ability to build blocks and set up facades, making every foreigner who visits feel like China has already become modernized and powerful. The real China can only be understood if you come here yourself. When you actually visit China, you’ll discover that everything is fake—none of it is truly high-tech!\r\n\r\nSpecial note: Except for Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, Chongqing, Qingdao, Xiamen, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Ningbo. I hope foreign friends will avoid visiting these cities,Because these cities are the 'Brahmin caste' of Chinese cities.",

Thailands just old people and farmers and indians and bar workers street workers and ladibois and awkward foreigners and old balding white guys n sexpats and just awkward cringe weird middle age foreigners. farmers blasting random music to farmers and old people isnt nightlife. how embarrassing its about sorry as japan with its angry bitter easily jealous sorry loner weeb foreigners with giant chip on shoulder who suddenly thinks they can party standing front of a convenience store to its 5 foot short 115 pound high pitch voiced frail skinny annoying no friends japanese autistic mute speech impediment loners walking alone wearing backpacks randomly blurting out autistic mute sounds and passing out from can of beer. and its embarrassing diminutive puny tiny little cars with tiny wheels going 15 mph toki yoki yo fastaa fastaaaa\n\nspeeds chinese streams were the most embarrassing streams to date. chinese embarrassed itself to the entire world. zero cool factor zero vibes. everything was planned out and artificial and never natural. china was just all rural farmer looking old people and nerdy disgusting looking eyeglasses wearing with strong chinese vietnamese accents who all dress like its 1960s. all the chinese look like they have horrible body and mouth odor and talk with strong vietnamese accent. the only thing Chinese cities have to offer is putting lights on office buildings and looking at them at night. how lame. Chinese cities have zero culture and extremely boring artificial neighbhoods. just office buildings lit up at night and shopping malls. china embarrassed itself to the entire world. how embarrassing.....",

Unlike China and the DPRK, South Korea is a vassal state of the USA with no real autonomy; a little Western outpost in Asia comprised of sycophantic Asians subservient to the West. And this fact is why you always see Koreans like you whining in the comments and trashing other countries like China. Because you are INSECURE. Shame and insecurity are natural psychological reactions for being a country of servile pushovers who sold themselves to the devil. Now go kiss Uncle Sam's a55. Go eat some SPAM.

This commemorative act holds profound historical significance: From 1938 to 1944, Japanese military forces conducted 6 years and 10 months of indiscriminate bombing campaigns targeting civilian areas and commercial districts in Chongqing and neighboring cities during the Second Sino-Japanese War. These atrocities resulted in over 30,000 immediate civilian deaths and more than 6,600 indirect casualties. To honor those lost in the bombings, Chongqing observes this annual memorial through the siren test.\n\nBeyond this solemn remembrance, Chongqing is a vibrant city where you'll experience genuine warmth and hospitality. We wholeheartedly welcome visitors to explore our mountain city's rich cultural heritage, savor iconic hotpot cuisine, and discover why Chongqing captivates hearts worldwide！",

A 20-year-old boy who is already wealthy having such a positive outlook on life makes me really want to leave you a message.

Moreover, at the founding of New China, there were more things to be done，if I'm a leader, and I'm not allowed to have any problems at this critical moment.",

    "text": "A little sad that he didn't show actual \"nightlife\" as in exploring the actual life in the city during the evening/night and showing things like local spots, clubs and parties. I'm aware that this is hard when you're a popular streamer surrounded by hundreds of people but no one says Speed can't make \"normal\"/pre-recorded videos in China that don't reveal his real time location all the time and also have other advantages such as better and more immersive image quality (he could potentially film 8K/60FPS/HDR or even VR180/VR360 which would be truly next level and would feel like you're actually there), having a more intimate/meaningful setting, they could have better planning and post production/editing possibilities etc. (I'd just advice to not make too many cuts as that could feel too artificial/mainstream/Mr. Beast-style and I think a more calm/intimate unscripted/unedited experience could be better here, basically similar to his streams just pre-recorded). And if too many people recognize and follow him they could just drive to another location and film there. Of course that doesn't mean he should do this instead of live streaming as those have their own place. I'm just saying he could do some of these videos besides live streaming and they could be very successful, if you look at these \"Walking through China in 4K/HDR\" videos they have millions of views and if they'd featured Speed I bet they would have even more. At the end of the day it doesn't even matter that much if it's streamed or pre-recorded since the likelihood that you're able to meaningfully interact with Speed through the chat while he's streaming is basically zero anyways. So the main advantage of streaming really only is the feeling of knowing this is actually happening right now.",

I used to say often: If those people who believe they live in a ‘developed’ country, who think they lead a bast life in Europe, were to truly go and witness China for themselves—their entire worldview would shatter. They’d even begin to doubt their life. They’d realize: They were the frogs at the bottom of the well all along. They’d see how the world could already have become like this, and wonder: On what grounds did I ever look down on Chinese people? What right did I have to mock them? In the eyes of the Chinese, I was the clown. Every single thing they took pride in, every joy they believed was real—all of it would be a joke. They’d see that they were the ones trapped in a closed, deceitful nation. Finally, someone has proven this point for me. Thank you, Speed.",

What shocked him and his team was that the fans here respected him very much. They were excited but very restrained when they saw him. They knew that he was tired and would give him water. They knew that he was hungry and would feed him. This was the case in every city he passed through! Because this is the Chinese etiquette of hospitality. Friends coming from afar must be fed and well-nourished!\r\n\r\nHe met Tian Yiming and sang his favorite song \"Love You at 105 Degrees\" together;\r\n\r\nHe climbed the Great Wall and saw the super weapon of Chinese aunties: \"Level 10 Beauty\";\r\n\r\nHe went to Shaolin Temple, made friends through martial arts and met Master Liang, who may be the best martial arts teacher in his life;\r\n\r\nHe ate an authentic Chengdu hot pot and tasted what authentic spicy and hot is;\r\n\r\nHe saw why Chongqing is called the cyberpunk city, and also showed the world the real shock of China beyond the foreign media filter;\r\n\r\nHe had a beautiful encounter on a cruise ship in Hong Kong that saved the entire live broadcast. A sweet girl from Zhejiang showed him the cuteness, friendliness, innocence and romance of Chinese girls;\r\n\r\nHe experienced the high-tech from China in Shenzhen that stunned the world;\r\n\r\nHe finally came to Changsha and finally met Da Zhangwei, and sang Sunshine Rainbow Little White Horse together. It was also because of Da Zhangwei's popular song that he won countless fans in China;\r\n\r\nHe also met a friendly and enthusiastic Chinese uncle who treated him as a brother. He followed him all the way in various cities in China and took care of him willingly. This is the best interpretation of fate and friendship from Chinese men!\r\n\r\nThank you Speed, thank you for showing the world the true side of this country and the people on this land!\r\n\r\nThere is an old Chinese saying: \"It is a great pleasure to have friends coming from afar! All people in the world are brothers!\"\r\nI guess Speed ​​has realized the meaning of this sentence during his trip to China!",
